# Augmented Physics-Based Model

This repository contains two projects:

1. **APBM Codes (Folder: `apbm_tales_2022`)**
   - This folder contains the original MATLAB codes for the Augmented Physics-Based Model (APBM).
   - It includes two examples:
     - Lorenz Attractor Models
     - Constant-Turning-Rate Models
   - For more details, refer to the paper:

2. **High-Order Markov Model Extension (Folder: `high_order_Markov_shuo_2023`)**
   - This folder extends the APBM to high-order Markov models, which some may refer to as non-Markov models.
   - It includes two common high-order Markov model applications:
     - Auto-Regressive Model (AR(3))
     - State Estimation in a Delay-Feedback Control Problem
